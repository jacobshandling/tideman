# tideman - a program that runs a Tideman election

This is my submission for [Problem Set 3 of Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/3/tideman/).

Note that this program makes use of the cs50.h header file, which exists in [CS50's online IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/). To run it, compile tideman.c and run the resulting binary within that IDE.
