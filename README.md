# tideman - a program that runs a Tideman election

This is my submission for [Problem Set 3 of Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/3/tideman/)

Note that this program makes use of the cs50.h header file, which exists in [CS50s online IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/). To run it, open tideman.c within that IDE.
